# Swift Array Index Out of Bounds Error
This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: attempting to access an element in an array using an index that is out of bounds.  Accessing an element beyond the array's valid index range (0 to count-1) leads to a runtime exception.

The `bug.swift` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.swift` presents solutions to prevent this error.
